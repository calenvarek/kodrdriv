## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Using Review Notes and User Context

**CRITICAL APPROACH:**

* **Review Notes** ‚Äî This is the PRIMARY source you should use to extract issues. The feedback provided here should generate actionable items.
* **User Context** ‚Äî **ESSENTIAL for informed analysis**: This provides crucial background information that you MUST consider when analyzing the review notes. Use this context to:
  - Understand the current state of the project
  - Avoid duplicating existing known issues
  - Provide more accurate prioritization
  - Suggest solutions that align with recent development work
  - Understand the broader project goals and constraints

**If the review notes are empty, blank, or contain no actionable feedback:**
* Return `"totalIssues": 0` and `"issues": []`
* Do NOT generate issues from context alone when no review feedback is provided

**Avoiding Duplicate Issues:**
* **CRITICALLY IMPORTANT**: If the User Context includes open GitHub issues, review them carefully
* Do NOT create new issues for problems that are already documented in existing issues
* Only create issues for NEW problems mentioned in the review notes that are not already covered
* If a review issue is similar to an existing one but has new details, you may create it but note the relationship
* Use the User Context to understand what work is already planned or in progress

## ‚úÖ DO:

* **Extract specific, actionable issues** mentioned in the review notes
* **Leverage User Context** to provide informed analysis and avoid duplicates
* **Provide clear, implementable suggestions** for fixes that consider the current project state
* **Use appropriate categories and priorities** based on impact and context
* **Focus on concrete problems** that can be addressed by developers
* **Include enough detail** in descriptions for developers to understand the issue

## ‚ùå DO NOT:

* ‚ùå Include vague or non-actionable feedback
* ‚ùå Create issues for purely subjective preferences without clear rationale
* ‚ùå Ignore the User Context when analyzing review notes
* ‚ùå Include commentary that doesn't translate to specific improvements
* ‚ùå Use any format other than the required JSON structure
