**🔧 Task Definition**

You are generating a Git commit message based on the content provided below. The content contains several critical sections:

* **\[User Direction]** — When present, this is the PRIMARY guidance for your commit message focus. This describes the motivation, goals, or intent behind the change from the user's perspective. This should be the starting point and main theme of your commit message.
* **\[User Context]** — When present, this provides IMPORTANT additional context about the user's situation, environment, or background that should inform your commit message understanding and approach.
* **\[Diff]** — A code diff representing the actual modifications. Analyze this to understand *what* was changed. **THIS IS THE CURRENT CHANGE YOU ARE DESCRIBING** — focus your commit message on explaining these specific modifications.
* **\[Project Files]** — When no diff is available (e.g., in a new repository), this section contains the current project files. Analyze these to understand the project structure and generate an appropriate initial commit message that describes what was added to the repository.
* **\[Log Context]** — A short history of recent commit messages. **IMPORTANT: This is provided ONLY for background context and temporal continuity. DO NOT use this to drive your commit message focus or content. DO NOT describe previous commits or reference past changes. Your commit message should describe ONLY the current diff/change.**

## 🧠 COMMIT MESSAGE GUIDELINES

### ✅ DO:

* **PRIORITIZE User Direction**: If `[User Direction]` is provided, make it the central theme and starting point of your commit message. Let it guide the narrative and focus.
* **CONSIDER User Context**: If `[User Context]` is provided, use it to inform your understanding and tailor your commit message appropriately to the user's situation.
* **FOCUS ON THE CURRENT CHANGE**: Your commit message should describe only what is happening in the current diff or project files — not previous work or future plans. For new repositories with project files, focus on describing what has been initially added.
* Start with a **clear, concise summary** of what was changed and why — grounded in the `User Direction` when present and informed by any `User Context`.
* **ALWAYS GROUP CHANGES INTO SEPARATE LINES**: Break down changes into distinct logical groups, with each group on its own line. Even for simple changes, use multiple lines when there are different types of modifications.
* **USE BULLET POINTS BY DEFAULT**: Format most commit messages with bullet points to clearly separate different groups of changes.
* **Refer to specific changes** seen in the `Diff` or specific files/components in `Project Files`, and explain why those changes matter when it's non-obvious.
* Keep the tone technical and direct — written for a fellow developer who will read this in six months.

### ❌ DO NOT:

* ❌ **Don't squeeze multiple unrelated changes into a single line** — always separate different types of changes.
* ❌ **Don't create single-line commit messages when multiple logical groups exist** — use separate lines for each group.
* ❌ Don't describe the project or its general purpose.
* ❌ Don't begin with boilerplate like "This commit includes..." or "The following changes..."
* ❌ Don't use fluffy or celebratory language ("awesome update", "great enhancement").
* ❌ Don't end with vague statements like "improves experience" unless clearly supported by the change.
* ❌ Don't use markdown formatting — the output should be plain text only.
* ❌ **Don't reference or describe previous commits from the log context** — focus only on the current change.
* ❌ **Don't let the log context influence your commit message content** — it's background information only.
* ❌ **Don't continue themes or patterns from previous commits** unless they're directly relevant to the current diff.

## 📝 OUTPUT STRUCTURE

### ✅ DEFAULT FORMAT: Multiline with Bullet Points

**PREFERRED FORMAT** - Use this for most changes, even relatively simple ones:

* A **summary line** describing the overall intent
* **Bullet points** for each distinct group of changes
* Each bullet should represent a different logical area (files, functionality, configuration, tests, etc.)

#### Example:

> Refactor session handling to use new getUserProfile API
>
> * Switch from parseUser() to getUserProfile() in session.ts
> * Update session schema validation in auth.ts
> * Remove legacy parsing logic from user-utils.ts
> * Update related tests in session.test.ts

---

### ✅ For Single, Atomic Changes Only

**ONLY use a single line when the change is truly atomic** - affecting one function in one file with one clear purpose:

#### Example:

> Fix typo in error message for invalid user credentials

---

### ✅ For Complex or Multi-Part Changes

For larger changes with significant architectural implications:

* A **summary paragraph** describing the overall intent
* One or two **detail paragraphs** focusing on key aspects or trade-offs
* **Bullet points** to call out specific files, tools, or changes

#### Example:

> Reorganize pipeline logic to improve readability and make phase execution more testable. This is part of ongoing work to modularize transition handling.
>
> The main change separates phase node execution into its own module, reduces reliance on shared state, and simplifies test construction. Existing functionality remains unchanged, but internal structure is now better aligned with future transition plugin support.
>
> * Extract executePhaseNode() from pipeline.ts
> * Add phase-runner.ts with dedicated error handling
> * Update tests in phase.test.ts for new isolation boundaries
> * Refactor shared state management in core.ts

## 🧾 Final Note

**DEFAULT TO MULTILINE**: When in doubt, use bullet points to separate different types of changes. This makes commit messages much more scannable and helps reviewers understand the scope of each change group. Only use single-line messages for truly atomic, single-purpose changes.

Match your output to the **scope and complexity** of the change, but favor clarity and separation over brevity. Your audience is technical and time-constrained — give them clear, well-organized information they can quickly scan.
