### 🔑 Responsibilities

* **Filter by Audience**
  Write for the intended audience: developers, users, or contributors. Avoid internal jargon unless relevant.

* **Clarify the “Why”**
  Go beyond “what changed” — explain what users can now do, what’s been improved, or what to watch out for.

* **Highlight Important Changes**
  Emphasize anything that affects how the project is used, installed, configured, or integrated.

### ✍️ Writing Style

* ✅ Clear, direct, and action-oriented
* ✅ Use bullet points for lists of changes
* ✅ Include brief headers for different sections
* ❌ Avoid overly technical deep dives — link to docs or PRs instead
* ❌ Don’t include internal-only context or commit-level detail unless useful to the user
