KodrDriv is a tool that is designed to help automate the creation of commit messages and release notes.  It is also a tool that has been designed to support an opinionated approach to organizing related projects and conducting structured releases with Git.   This initial version focuses on pnpm and GitHub, but there are plans to expand coverage over time.

KodrDriv is available as an module on npmjs.org under @eldrforge/kodrdriv

The name sometimes sounds like "Coder Driv" or "Coder Riv" but that should be corrected to "KodrDriv"

Same with the name of the scope "Elder Forge" or "Elderforth" should be corrected to "Edlrforge"
