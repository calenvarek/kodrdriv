# KodrDriv

KodrDriv is an AI-powered Git workflow automation tool that generates intelligent commit messages and release notes from your code changes. It analyzes your repository to create meaningful documentation while automating the entire release process.

## Why KodrDriv?

Writing good commit messages and release notes is time-consuming and often done when you're least in the mood for reflection. **KodrDriv was created specifically to solve the "context switch" problem** that happens when you've been deep in code and Git asks you to summarize what you've done.

KodrDriv reads your code changes and Git history to automatically generate contextual, meaningful documentation that reflects your actual work.

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g @eldrforge/kodrdriv
```


## Quick Start

## About the Name

Like Thor's hammer, this tool smashes through your repetitive coding tasks. But unlike MjÃ¶lnir, it won't make you worthy â€” it'll just make you faster. Strike through commits, forge releases, and channel the lightning of AI to automate your workflow. Because sometimes you need a hammer, and sometimes you need a tool that actually works. Pirate.
