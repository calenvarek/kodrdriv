# KodrDriv

KodrDriv is a powerful utility designed to automatically generate intelligent release notes and commit messages from your Git repository. It analyzes commit history, pull requests, and related metadata to create comprehensive, well-structured documentation of your project's evolution. By leveraging advanced AI-powered analysis, it helps teams maintain clear visibility into their codebase's development history while reducing the manual effort typically required for changelog maintenance.

## What is KodrDriv?

KodrDriv is an AI-powered Git workflow automation tool designed to solve the common problem of writing meaningful commit messages and release notes. It provides a unified way to:

- **Generate intelligent commit messages** from your code changes
- **Create comprehensive release notes** automatically from Git history
- **Automate the entire release process** with pull request and GitHub integration
- **Manage workspace dependencies** for monorepo and multi-package development
- **Maintain consistent documentation** with minimal manual effort

## Why KodrDriv?

Writing good commit messages and release notes is time-consuming and often done when you're least in the mood for reflection. **KodrDriv was created specifically to solve the "context switch" problem that happens when you've been deep in code and Git asks you to summarize what you've done.**

Without KodrDriv, you need to manually:
- Stop your flow to write commit messages
- Remember all the changes you made across multiple files
- Craft meaningful release notes from scattered commit messages
- Coordinate complex release workflows with multiple steps

KodrDriv reads your code changes and Git history to automatically generate contextual, meaningful documentation that reflects your actual work.

## Installation

Install KodrDriv globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g @eldrforge/kodrdriv
```

This will make the `kodrdriv` command available globally on your system.
